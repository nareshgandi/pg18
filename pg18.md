Allow skip scans of btree indexes

These performance gains extend to query optimizations and new indexing features. PostgreSQL 18 adds support for using "skip scan" lookups on multicolumn B-tree indexes, which can result in faster execution times for queries that omit a "=" condition on one or more prefix index columns.

This release also includes optimizations for WHERE clauses that contain OR and IN (...) statements to better utilize recent indexing improvements which can also result in better query performance.

PostgreSQL 18 now supports parallel builds for GIN indexes, which are commonly used for search over JSON and full-text data. 

CREATE TABLE articles (
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
title text,
body text
);

INSERT INTO articles (title, body)
SELECT
'Title ' || g,
repeat('This is a sample article content with some searchable keywords. ', 10)
FROM generate_series(1, 500000) g;

CREATE INDEX gin_articles_body_idx ON articles
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', body));

 Example 2: JSONB GIN Index with Parallel Build

Step 1: Create a table with JSONB data

CREATE TABLE logs (
id serial PRIMARY KEY,
data jsonb
);

Step 2: Insert dummy JSONB records

INSERT INTO logs (data)
SELECT jsonb_build_object(
'user_id', trunc(random()*1000000)::int,
'event', 'click',
'details', jsonb_build_object('url', 'https://example.com/' || g)
)
FROM generate_series(1, 500000) g;

Step 3: Create a GIN index on the jsonb column

CREATE INDEX gin_logs_data_idx ON logs
USING GIN (data);

-- This build will be parallelized if the planner decides it's worthwhile

Step 4: Run a JSONB query that benefits from the GIN index

SELECT *
FROM logs
WHERE data @> '{"event": "click"}';

üõ†Ô∏è How to Monitor Parallel Index Usage

Use EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE, BUFFERS) while building the index:

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE)
CREATE INDEX gin_logs_data_idx ON logs
USING GIN (data);


 PostgreSQL 18 also has performance improvements in text processing, including general speedups to the upper/lower functions and a new built-in collation PG_UNICODE_FAST.

CREATE TABLE..

ENERATED ALWAYS AS ( generation_expr ) [ STORED | VIRTUAL ] 
This clause creates the column as a generated column. The column cannot be written to, and when read the result of the specified expression will be returned.

When VIRTUAL is specified, the column will be computed when it is read, and it will not occupy any storage. When STORED is specified, the column will be computed on write and will be stored on disk. VIRTUAL is the default.

The generation expression can refer to other columns in the table, but not other generated columns. Any functions and operators used must be immutable. References to other tables are not allowed.


 PostgreSQL supports bearer tokens, defined in RFC 6750, which are a type of access token used with OAuth 2.0 where the token is an opaque string. The format of the access token is implementation specific and is chosen by each authorization server.

 yhis release deprecates md5 password authentication in favor of using SCRAM authentication that was first added in PostgreSQL 10

Additionally, EXPLAIN ANALYZE now shows how many index lookups occur during an index scan, and EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE includes CPU, WAL, and average read statistics

Your installation contains extensions that should be updated
with the ALTER EXTENSION command.  The file
    update_extensions.sql
when executed by psql by the database superuser will update
these extensions.

Upgrade Complete
----------------
Some statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade.
Once you start the new server, consider running these two commands:
    /usr/pgsql-18/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages --missing-stats-only
    /usr/pgsql-18/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-only
Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh
